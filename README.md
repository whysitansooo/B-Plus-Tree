# üå≥ B+ Tree Implementation in C++

## üìå Overview
This repository contains a **console-based implementation of a B+ Tree** data structure in C++.  
B+ Trees are balanced tree structures that maintain sorted data and allow for **efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations** with **logarithmic time complexity**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Tree Initialization**  
  Define the order of the B+ Tree (maximum number of keys per node).

- **Key-Value Operations**
  - **Insert**: Add key-value pairs to the tree.
  - **Delete**: Remove keys from the tree.
  - **Search**: Find values by key or search within a key range.

- **Tree Visualization**  
  Display the current structure of the B+ Tree with detailed node information.

## üîç How B+ Trees Work

- Stores data in **sorted order**.
- Maintains balance to ensure **O(log n)** performance for insert, delete, and search.
- All **data records are stored at the leaf level**.
- Uses **internal nodes for indexing**.
- Automatically **rebalances** when nodes become overfull or underfull.
